I am getting overly excited for the latest version of Scala (2.10) to come out. They've been releasing milestone after milestone over the past several months, and just recently released a "[Release Candidate](http://www.scala-lang.org/node/13096)." This means they must be close to releasing the official "2.10" version... I hope.

I'm particularly interested in a couple of the new features in particular; "[Futures and Promises](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/futures.html)" and "[Implicit Classes](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/pending/implicit-classes.html)". Read up!

I want to play with these! I want to make code that uses them and put it on my site, but since there's no version of [Lift](http://liftweb.net/) built against Scala 2.10 yet, I can't do that.
