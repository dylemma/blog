It's time for me to write about my blog (how meta). This site is served using [Lift](http://liftweb.net/), which is a really great web framework written in Scala. I was introduced to it (and Scala) for a project at work, and after getting over the initial learning curve, I love it! Lift does all kinds of cool stuff; its templating system is very powerful (and very easy to customize); it handles a bunch of security concerns so that I don't have to; it has support for Ajax and Comet with very little effort from me, and much, much more.

Right now, the only of those things that I'm using for this blog is the templating system. I use that to put these blog posts onto the page. No need to write these in HTML! No need to even have them inside the server! I write my blog posts using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and save them elsewhere on my computer. (I should mention [dillinger.io](http://dillinger.io/) because it is my favorite Markdown editor.) Then I wrote some code that loads the posts up, uses [Actuarius](https://github.com/chenkelmann/actuarius) to turn the Markdown text into HTML, then uses Lift's template system to make sure that HTML gets embedded into the page you're seeing right now.
